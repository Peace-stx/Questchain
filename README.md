# Questchain

A gamified bounties and task system for communities built on Stacks blockchain, enabling smart contract-powered quest boards to incentivize contributions with multi-token reward support and advanced categorization.

## Overview

Questchain allows communities to create bounty-based tasks (quests) with automated reward distribution and reputation tracking through NFTs. Contributors can submit work, get verified, and earn both STX/SIP-010 token rewards and reputation NFTs. The system now includes comprehensive categorization and tagging for better quest organization and discovery.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Management**: Quest approval, rejection, and cancellation with proper refund mechanisms

### Categories & Tags System (New in v2.1)
* **Quest Categories**: Organized quest types with dedicated category management
